## ðŸ’¬Description
DISClive is a live music discovery platform. Users can search artists they love, find artists that are similar, and see if any of those similar artists are playing shows near them. 


## Purpose 
* AS A lover of live music

<br></br>
* GIVEN an artist/concert discovery platform
* WHEN I search for a familiar artist
* THEN I am presented with five similar artists relating to my search that are saved to local storage
* WHEN I view the five similar artists
* THEN I am presented with the artist names, a button to â€˜find showsâ€™, and a â€˜trashâ€™ button
* WHEN I click â€˜trashâ€™
* THEN I no longer see the similar artist presented on the list
* WHEN I click â€˜find showsâ€™
* THEN I am redirected to a second page that displays the artistâ€™s upcoming shows â€“ if the artist does not have upcoming shows, then I will be shown an alert stating â€˜Artist has no upcoming showsâ€™
* WHEN I view the shows
* THEN I see the city, date, and button for â€˜see more info & get ticketsâ€™
* WHEN I click â€˜see more info & get ticketsâ€™
